    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Stuffed peppers are a delectable dish that combines colorful bell peppers with a flavorful filling. First, the peppers are carefully hollowed out, removing their seeds and inner membranes.
            The filling, often a mixture of ground meat (such as beef, turkey, or sausage), cooked rice or quinoa, diced vegetables (typically including onions, tomatoes, and assorted veggies), and an array of seasonings and herbs like garlic, paprika, oregano, and basil, is meticulously prepared.
            The peppers are generously stuffed with this flavorful concoction and then baked in the oven until they become tender and slightly caramelized, while the filling cooks to perfection. Some variations even involve crowning the peppers with cheese, such as mozzarella or Parmesan, for a gooey, cheesy finish.
            In essence, stuffed peppers offer a delightful symphony of tastes and textures, harmonizing the sweet, roasted peppers with the savory, seasoned fillings, creating a visually appealing and comforting dish that can shine as a main course or a side.
