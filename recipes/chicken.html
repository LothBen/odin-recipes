        <p>
            Chicken enchiladas are a delicious and popular Mexican dish that consists of tortillas rolled around a flavorful filling of cooked chicken, typically seasoned with spices like cumin and chili powder.
            The rolled tortillas are then placed in a baking dish, covered with a rich and savory enchilada sauce made from ingredients like tomatoes, chili peppers, and spices.
            This sauce adds a tangy and slightly spicy kick to the dish.

            After being smothered in the sauce, the enchiladas are topped with a generous amount of cheese, often shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack, and then baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the enchiladas are heated through.
            Garnishes such as fresh cilantro, diced onions, sour cream, and sliced jalape√±os can be added for extra flavor and texture.
